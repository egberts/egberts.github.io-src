summary: So you want to make a blank-type of PKI certificate but unsure of what X509v3 extensions to use.
lang: en
private: False

There are several types of PKI certificates used today:

* Web TLS
 * TLS server
 * TLS client, used in mutual TLS (mTLS) rarely
* Certificate Authority (CA)
 * Root CA
 * Intermediate CA
 * Crossover CA
* Code Signing
* Timestamping
* Certificate Revocation List (CRL)
* Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP)
* 

You can add X.509 extensions to a certificate at two different stages of the creation of PKI certification:

* When creating the Certificate Signing Request (CSR)
* When signing the certificate using the Root (or Intermediate) CA certificate
 * using `openssl ca`
 * using `openssl x509`


With the X509v3 extensions and its attributes detailed in [OpenSSL config file by section]({filename}openssl-conf-by-section.md), this article will assign them to each type of certificate:

Root CA
=======
Following the progression from top to bottom, Root CA is at the top.

```ini
# BC must be present
# BC must be marked `critical`
# BC must have a `cA`
# `cA` field must be set TRUE
# pathLenConstraint may not be present
# pathLenConstraint must be non-zero for a non-leaf CA node
basicConstraints=critical,CA:TRUE

subjectKeyIdentifier=hash

# if Root CA key is used to sign OCSP responses
keyUsage=critical,digitalSignature,keyCertSign,cRLSign
# if Root CA key is NOT being used to sign OCSP responses
#keyUsage=critical,keyCertSign,cRLSign
# absolutely no certificatePolicies here  (CAB BR-1.7.6 s7.1.6.2)
# absolutely no extendedKeyUsage here

# For Cross Certificates that share a Subject Distinguished Name and Subject Public
Key with a Root Certificate operated in accordance with these Requirements, this
extension MAY be present. 

If present for XCC, this extension SHOULD NOT be marked
critical. This extension MUST only contain usages for which the issuing CA has
verified the Cross Certificate is authorized to assert. This extension MAY contain
the anyExtendedKeyUsage [RFC5280] usage, if the Root Certificate(s) associated
1Non‚Äêcritical Name Constraints are an exception to RFC 5280 (4.2.1.10), however, they MAY be used until
the Name Constraints extension is supported by Application Software Suppliers whose software is used by
a substantial portion of Relying Parties worldwide.
