Enabling Long-Running Process in Systemd
===========================

Beginning with systemd-230, all user processes are killed when a user 
session is ended, even if `NOHUP` signal (via `nohup` command) is used, 
or the process uses the daemon() or setsid() functions. 
This is a deliberate change from a historically permissive environment 
to a more restrictive one. 
The new behavior may cause issues if you depend on long running 
programs (e.g., `screen` or `tmux`) to remain active after ending your 
user session. 
There are three ways to enable lingering processes to remain after 
a user session is ended.

Process Lingering for Selected Users
------------------------------------
Enable process lingering for only selected users: 
* Normal users have permission to enable process lingering with the 
command loginctl enable-linger for their own user. 
* System administrators can use the same command with a user argument 
to enable for a user.  That user can then use the systemd-run command to 
start long running processes. For example: `systemd-run --scope --user /usr/bin/screen`. 
If you enable lingering for your user, the `user@.service` will remain even 
after all login sessions are closed, and will automatically start at 
system boot. This has the advantage of explicitly allowing and 
disallowing processes to run after the user session has ended, 
but breaks backwards compatibility with tools like nohup and 
utilities that use deamon().

System-wide Process Lingering
------------------------------

Enable system-wide process lingering: 
You can set `KillUserProcesses=no` in `/etc/systemd/logind.conf` to enable 
process lingering globally for all users. 
This has the benefit of leaving the old method available to all users at 
the expense of explicit control.

Disable at Build-Time
---------------------
Disable at build-time: You can enable lingering by default while 
building systemd by adding the switch `-Ddefault-kill-user-processes=false` 
to the meson command for systemd. 
This completely disables the ability of systemd to kill user 
processes at session end.
