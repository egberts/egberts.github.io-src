A long analysis of how to get HGTV video channel, its Internet provider throughout my house in the cheapest manner possible.

My beautiful wife imposed a lovely request of "I want HGTV" anywhere.
Argh. What an exercise in analysis of the current video streaming marketplace. 

Here goes.

HGTV is owned by Discovery, Inc.  Content of HGTV are viewable using your favorite web browser on your laptop, PC, or smartphone. But to view them directly on your TV typically requires a certain type of settop box for each TV screen, as a minimum.  

HGTV offers 1040p (HD); and also offers the Ultra HD (8K) but only on Apple TV settop box or Amazon Fire TV settop box. 

HGTV is provided by a direct video streaming provider such as Discovery+, Philo, Fubo, DirecTV Stream, Sling. 

I have to make HGTV appear on all TV screens in the household with minimal fixed cost and with a most minimal monthly fee.

Simplest thing to do is to order ATT Internet/Entertainment-TV bundle (for $181/month, included all applicable taxes and weirdo surchages).  Checkbox, checked.

Now, that the marketplace has fragmented and decoupled TV from Internet due to TV being available directly over IP network, I became curious to what is cheaper out there.

Before I do that, I gotta understand the current landscape.

As in "I know I can do better than $181/month".


# Modified History 

In the beginning, terrestrial television were delivered by "over-the-air" (OTA) aerial system, cable television, and or satelite television systems using just 1 video encoding method.

<img src="/images/antenna-dipole-rabbit-ear-foiled.jpg" alt="Foil-encrusted rabbit-ear TV antenna" title="Foil-encrusted rabbit-ear TV antenna" width="200" />

Now it is full-tilt toward "[streaming television](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_television)", a form of digital 
distribution of television content as streaming media delivered over the 
Internet.  

Today's Smart TV can handle over 140+ video encoding methods, many concurrently (e.g.  picture-in-a-picture) and even has standardized SmartTV apps ([HbbTV.org](https://www.hbbtv.org/)).

ATT TV Entertainment Bundle (includes Internet) is still the only one that maintains controls of that channel selector within this flourishing IPTV marketplace.

If I wanted to explore cheaper packages, then my expectatation of having this single "channel" step would be fading away; my original TV selection experience would be further complicated by:

  * select the video streaming server, then
  * display the TV guide
  * select the video content ("channel-like")

I think that new standards will soon emerge for this much-covet TV guide/single-channel-selector feature to restore the "channel" knob; but for now, ATT TV combined with ATT Internet has mostly nailed this.

The word "channel" losts its useful meaning:  we are seeing more of the following terms (with parenthesized old-timer notations):

   video creator (e.g., Hollywood)
     * individual video creator (YouTubers user, TikTok user, Periscope)
       * * content video creator (Influencer)
     * community video creator (PBS)
     * corporate video creator (Disney)
   video distributor (Viacom)
   video aggregator (movie theater chain)
   video streamer (movie theater, TV station)

whose action words are:

   video streaming
   video-streamed

# ISP/TV Providers

Legally, Internet and TV streaming providers are now two separate but competing entities.  

Days of marketing and packaging both Internet and TV together are going the way of the dinasours, as more streaming video providers (20+) and video repackagers (80+) enters the marketplace. 

## Hidden Surcharges for Local TVs

More so, OTA (terrestial) TV broadcasts being captured and resent over Internet are now being charged as "extra".  This phenomenon comes in form of the new billing line called "[Broadcast Fee](https://www.cabletv.com/blog/what-is-a-broadcast-tv-fee)" on the bill of your cable utility provider ... since March 2022.  And it is starting at least $20.00/month by the major cable TV providers.  

Curiously, ATT TV (sent as TV over IP via DirecTV Stream, or IPTV) is too charging this $20/m even though the law targeted cable companies (of which ATT is not a cable provider of any sort).  I find that you can (nicely) request this to be removed with ATT customer support using "local TV and affliate video sources are already included in the bundle" as noted on their website.  [Lawsuits galore!](https://regmedia.co.uk/2020/05/27/charter-bait-switch-lawsuit.pdf) because hidden charge is basically deceptive marketing.

Noticed the term ISP is not being used much longer.  The act of filling our TV screens has been evolved.  We have IPTV provider as well as Internet Service Provider.

IPTV defines as multimedia services such as television/video/audio/text/graphics/data delivered over IP based networks.  IPTV delivers Live TV, Video On Demand (VOD) and Interactive TV (iTV) but not always local TV stations.

Caveat: I have mistaken the phrase "Live TV" to be as having also included local TV stations; it may NOT include local TVs.  Live TV currently means "directly delivered from the video server".  Doesn't say WHICH video source (live News, local TV, or On-Demand).  Pesky marketing terms, useless too.

## Series of Internet Pipes

ISPs have delivery system of fiber, video-free cable, and copper (DSL).
 
Consumer-wise, we now must shop for Internet and TV separately.  It is now a mixture of both (4 basic ways to order things for splashing your TV screen(s), but I have technically identify as currently closer to 134 ways).

As I have suspected, cable is going the way of dinosaurs despite being propped up savvy cable marketers against extreme technological superiority of fiber over two-wire cable.


# TV over IP

There are [two classes](https://broadbandnow.com/report/cable-vs-satellite-vs-iptv-vs-ott-streaming/) of video content over the Internet pipes to your TV screen.

* [IPTV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Protocol_television) (Verizon, Frontier, DirecTV Stream with ATT Internet)
* Over-The-Top (OTT) Streaming (Netflix, Hulu+, Disney+, Sling, DirecTV Stream)

In both cases, the consumer requests and receives content via Internet Protocol.

The primary difference between IPTV and OTT streaming is that OTT streamed content comes over the same open, unmanaged network as your email and web browsing while IPTV uses a private, dedicated network to deliver more consistent service.

In short, IPTV servers are closest to your residential Internet drop; OTT, not so much. And both use very different network protocols.


# Video Streaming Providers (VSP)

There are many VSP providers. Some are free, most are of paying variety. All do 
.  Worse, all VSPs support mixed-selection of [video protocols](https://blog.vidizmo.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-video-streaming-protocols) such as:

* Legacy protocol
    * Real-Time Messaging Protocol (RTMP) (YouTube, Adobe Flash/Macromedia)
    * Real-Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP) (used by most IP-based webcams)
    * HTTP Dynamic Streaming (HDS) (Adobe)
* HTTP-based protocol
    * [HTTP Live Streaming (HLS)](https://www.cdnetworks.com/media-delivery-blog/video-streaming-protocols/) (Apple, YouTube, all web browsers)
    * Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (MPEG-DASH) (nearly everyone except Apple)
    * Microsoft Smooth Streaming (MSS)
* Modern protocol
    * WebRTC (Google Meet, Discord, Houseparty, Gotomeeting, WhatsApp, Snapcaht and Facebook Messenger)
    * Secure Reliable Transport (SRT) (Microsoft, Telestream, Wowza, Alibaba Cloud, Comcast, Eurovision, and AVID)


Three kinds of VSPs are (in my words):

* Internet Presence Providers (IPP)
* multi-corporate repackagers
* custom VSPs

Internet Presence Provider

Internet Presence Provider is the one that ALSO  provides the Internet feed to your home (ATT).  Their video streaming servers are closest to your home (and not likely to suffer the occasional but distant Internet outage)

Multi-Corporate Repackagers

Multi-corporate feed repackagers are the ones that has to negotiate with many different corporate entities and movie studios for their video content and then maintain their own video-streaming distribution network (deep inside the Internet and some put their servers inside your IPP’s network closer to home). Outages will occur … randomly.  Hulu+, Fubo, Philo, SlingTV, DirecTV Stream, Funimation+, Fearless, Discovery+, Amazon Prime, Amazon Kids+, Mubi, Magnolia Select, Epix, YouTube TV, BritBox, Univision NOW, Unicorns.Live, Topix, SVTV, Sundance Now, Struum Bundle, Shudder, Screambox, Ovid TV, OutTV, Night Flight Plus, MagellanTV, Lifetime Movie Club, Kweli TV, KokowaTV, Indieflix, HopsterTV, History Vault, History Hit TV, hidive, Hallmark Movies Now, frndly TV, Flix Premier, Film Movement Plus, Fandor, Docsville, Dekku, Crunchyroll, Brown Sugar, Broadway HD, Boomerrang, BET+, Arrow Player, AMC+, Allblk, and Acorn TV.

Custom VSP

Custom VSPs are a vanity provider of video content.  Unlike multi-corporate repackagers, they also provides their own custom movie/TV series as well as pay for other video contents from various Hollywood studios.  Netflix, Apple TV+, Paramount+ Premium, Disney+, HBO Max, Showtime+ are all in their own rights act as movie studio, distributor, as well as Internet (VSP).  They too suffer occasional random outages as the multi-corporate repackagers have.  They are typically pricier (per channel) but are the only option if your favorite show(s) is hosted by only that one Custom VSP. 

Receivers

Roku, Chromecast, Website, FireStick, Android, macOS app, Windows 11 program, LinuxOS program, iPhone/iOS, Apple TV, Android TV, Amazon Fire TV, XboxOne Amazon Kindle, and smart TVs are receivers and are not providers.  Not all receivers works with all providers.  It is currently a consumer nightmare.  It is the bane of consumers to figure what receiver can receive any of the three kinds of VSP.



Sling Orange + Blue, 
Philo (live TV + on-demand content), 
Disney+ (bundled with Hulu and ESPN+), 
Paramount+ (CBS live TV + on-demande content), 
Hulu with Live TV (live TV + on-demand), and a few others. 

Channel

The smallest discrete component of our TV viewing experience is called a “channel”.  There are two kinds of channels:

* Over-the-air (OTA) TV channel
* Internet-streaming channel

The real world problem with both kinds of channels is this act of a consumer using the channel selector.  No receiver settop box can do both … seamlessly.  It is a crying shame there, as that is an untapped market waiting to grow.

Over-The-Air TV Channel

Local TV stations can still be received using those archaic but concerted fringe array of aluminum rod elements that are mounted on chimney tops … for free (save for that one-time antenna and wire expenses). Could do that antenna thingie too using just two-metal rods erected in upward V-formation and sometimes with rods being encrusted with crushed aluminum foils. 

We USED to get local TV stations over our cable provider … for free.  On other side, Internet Service Provider (ISP) had fold the cost of retransmitting local TV stations into your bill.  This all changed in U.S. last March 2022.

Gone are the freebies local TV channels over ISP.  Cables have tacked on this “Broadcast Fee”.

Rabbit antenna pickup of local TV channels still exists and for free but who climbs up and erects those nowadays? Or wants to constantly change INPUT on their TV or lay second but bulky cables throughout their house? All that just to watch local TV channels on their TV?  We now got many video streaming providers for that … but, But … BUT it is no longer free (now $25-70/month depending on what video streaming provider that we choose).


HGTV


HGTV is a video channel that only comes in form of pricy pre-packaged cable channel lineup OR obtained through Internet via many video streaming providers (as well as the Internet provider, ATT). Cable is out (bye, Comcast Spectrum). HGTV does host non-live content on their website but never directly as a streaming service, one must search for a multi-corporate repackager having HGTV. 

The magical sweetspot for consumers is ease of channel selection.  Single channel selector (and no INPUT flipping) means single “data utility provider” (my term).

Used to be that we can browse cable TV or INPUT-flip to Roku and separately browse a different list of channel line up.

Used to be that Smart TV can let us do this local TV station too.  


But smartifying each and every TVs and then burdening consumers with their login info on each devices AND for each vanity channels (not to mention that Netflix limits us to five separate devices or our SmartTV isn’t smart enough to get some of those channels).  That’s a real deal-breaker here. 

No need for SmartTV anymore.  Our next TV will be a cheaper computer monitor, albeit LARGER screen ones.

No need for coaxial cable anymore.  

Drop a fiber to the home

No need for flipping TV input at the TV between the different feeds of over-the-air or direct-to-the-home utility (formerly ISP/cable).  but going this route is going to be a lot more expensive.

Not picking local TV streaming means either going blind or Going back to over-the-air (OTA) TV setup; self-providing OTA (extra cabling feed to each room) is also the taking a step backward in form of figuring out which TV settings to flip between cableTV and OTA for each sitting to view.

It is that last step that is starting to be costing us dearly; its called “Broadcast Fee”.  $20+/month.  Probably will explode faster too but in a competitive wild-west manner.

For now, I think over-the-air TV feature has become an emergency component must-have and maintain at least on one TV to support this OTA and local TV stations would end up becoming seldom used unless we continue those TV INPUT-flipping.

Spending $20/month for “Broadcast Fee” is stupid, IMHO.  We can use our children ot hire local kids to flip TV inputs for far cheaper.





Based on intensive research, current selection


ATT Internet 1000Mbps: $89.99/mo for 12 mos when bundled, + taxes & equip fee. Other qualifying svc (min $19/mo) & combined bill req’d. $10/mo equip fee applies Incl unlimited internet data allowance ($30-value) (source: allconnect.com)

Broadcast Fee is a new profit-raking (March 2022) phenomenon; at least $20/month.  It delivers all your local over-the-air HD TV signals through ISP, EVEN if you did not order ATT TV option.

If we drop ATT TV here, ATT will still charge this $20.  We can politely ask remediation customer service to drop them.  if that fails, then 



Since we are trying to avoid “Broadcast Fee”, ATT prepackage bundle must include them, at least during their 1 year promotional period before we can ask to drop them.  And we still need ATT for their ATT Internet (as an IPP).  ATT TV remains problematic; intro period of ATT TV/Internet (in form of DirecTV Stream, plus as in not a satellite dish, but Internet-based) would cost us $35/month.

# Bandwidth Selection

Given the following consumption rate of bandwidth are:

* Ultra HD/4K 40    Mbps
* HD          8     Mbps
* Zoom        8     Mbps
* VRS (Deaf)  8     Mbps
* Facetime    4     Mbps
* YouTube     2     Mbps
* email       0.032 Mbps
* calendar    0.032 Mbps
* messaging   0.032 Mbps

Capacity selection really all boils down to how many do you want to support in a simultaneous manner within  your household (and mobile devices too).

So I opted for 300 Mbps, but only because there was a bundle deal; otherewise, I'd be looking at 200 or even 100Mbps.


# Who Offers Internet

* ATT TV (DirectTV Stream), $80/month (base $55+tax/m), 41 OTAs.

# Who Offers HGTV, MSNBC and Fox?

* Fubo Pro plan $70+tax/month, DVR free, 125-channels, most local OTAs

* Sling Blue plan, $35+tax/m, DVR free, 41-channels, most local OTAs

* DirectTV Stream, $95/month (base $70+tax/m), DVR free, all local OTAs.

* Hulu Live TV, $70+tax/month, DVR free, all local OTAs

If no local TV stations are desired, then:

* Philo, $25+tax/m, DVR free, 60+ channels, NO LOCAL OTA
* Hulu TV, $18+tax/month, DVR $10/m, NO LOCAL OTAs



# My Conclusion


* ATT Internet + ATT DirecTV Stream bundle 
    * 300Mbps download/upload speed ("$55/month")
    * free unlimit network cap ($30/month value)
    * one set-top box ($10/month); this is no longer a rental item; its like a cell-phone, you pay a little every month for up to 24 months, then its yours.
* extra set-top boxes, fully paid-for using full up-front method at $120/box. Also an option given that this ATT DirectTV Stream set-top box is not a rental anymore, one can still pay at $40, $20, $10, or $5/month (payoff is in 3/4/6/12 months).  

Risks:
* 14-day trial period before expensive pro-rata [early-termination fee (ETF)[(https://www.directv.com/legal/directv-stream-cancellation-policy/) of [$360](https://www.directv.com/legal/directv-stream-tos-eula-policy/).


## Set-Top Box, Ownership

The ATT DirecTV settop box is kinda like a rent-to-own thingie where ownership of settop box belongs to ATT until it is 100% fully paid for regardless, of your early termination or not. At any rate, the device would most assuredly go obsoleted and useless by then.  

So, plan on moving again with less than 2 years, rent the box.  

Planning on staying longer than two years, pick the $5/month (you'd be paying with cheaper dollars after inflation).  

Makes absolutely no sense to buy the box; in fact, ATT will force you to buy the box if you have a bad history of payment or non-returns)


# Monthly Outlook

Based on my intensive browsing, screenshotting, and saving nearly all of ATT's website for legal, EULA, ToS, and other legals in HTML format, I estimate the following surcharges:

Keep in mind, I haven't made that ATT Bundle phone call yet.

First-month outlook
```
 55.00   ATT Internet, 300Mbps max.
 79.99   ATT TV (now called DirecTV Stream)
 19.95   Activation Fee
 99.99   Professional Installation Fee (optional)
120.00   DirecTV settop box, quantity: one, paid in full, outright owned?
------ 
263.94   subtotal, taxable

 16.89   State+Local sales tax (6.4%)
 20.00   Broadcast Fee Surcharge (is that even taxable?)
======
300.83   your applicable credit card charge
```

Monthly (ordinary)
```
 55.00   ATT Internet, 300Mbps max.
 79.95   ATT TV (aka DirecTV Stream)
------
134.95   subtotal, products
  8.64   State+Local sales tax (6.4%)
======
143.59   Total
```


So I nailed it.  I dropped my Internet charges from $225 down to $143.


Any omission of accounting or itemization on my part is probably a hidden charge (from marketing material) and plan to take them to court over it.  Yeah, I read the fine-prints, video-streamed the entire ATT website, recorded all phone calls (with pre-approval).

Placed my order and confirmed above number with sales.

Now we await the second bill.


# Privacy

Do not forget to add exclusion of your personal identifying information (PII) from being sold to just about everyone else other than ATT.

# Ordering over the phone

Placing an order (mine is ATT 300 TV/Internet bundle) over the phone.

Do not confirm the order yet (fork over your credit card).  "I have more questions."

Things to talk about BEFORE HANGING UP but after your bundle order:

1. Ask all the questions up-front
2. Inquire about each billing cost
    * Broadcast Fee, ask if there are any; request to remove
    * State and local tax
    * Total bill

3. Explicitly request removal from:
    * [Customer Proprietary Network Information](https://www.att.com/ecpnioptout/InitiateCPNIForm.action) (CPNI)
    * [Business telemarketing](https://about.att.com/privacy/full_privacy_policy.html#choice)
    * Consumer telemarketing
    * Automated messaging over SMS/text
    * all postal mails (except for bills and legals)


And then ... give (me) your credit card.

Enjoy.
