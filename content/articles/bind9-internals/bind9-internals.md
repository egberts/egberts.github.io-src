Came across a really cool internal document detailing the many tangible
aspects of Bind9.  Nevermind that it is v9.3.1 (which is very old).

This paper reminds me of W. Richard Stevens' TCP Illustrated Vol I, II and 
Douglas Cromer's Illustrated TCP and Internetworking with TCP.  It is
that good.

This came from a student named Jinmei Tatuya of Kyoto who was with the KAME project (IPv6 prototype and lab).

He worked at ISC for 5 years as a Senior Software Architect so he's got this.

While he was working on an IPv6 book, this leftover Bind9-specific note appeared as a whitepaper.

The whitepaper details the:

* Process
* Network Queue
* Request
* Answer

And is replete with wonderful state diagrams and in-depth call-functional dependency diagrams.
