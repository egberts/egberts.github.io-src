Summary: What privacy of yours are being respected.

Only thing I can track is your IP address.

This webserver of this website has:

* no cookies

* nothing that might detract you from viewing this website as plainly, directly, and simply as possible.

There are no malicious behavior within this website such as:

* TCP sequence prediction attack
* HTTP session hijacking
  * HTTP magic cookie stealing/theft (HTTP/1.0+)
  * HTTP super cookie stealing/theft (HTTP/1.1)
  * HTTP session fixation

    * persistent XSS (aka Stored XSS or Type I)
    * reflected XSS (aka Non-Persistent or Type II)
    * DOM-based XSS (Type 0)
  * browser hijacking (malware)

While I may do authentication for one-time URL that I may email 
toward my prospective customers to protect against their email scanners 
from pre-visiting such sent links before it gets read by their own 
human eyes, this and any authentication being done are in accordance with 
this [Authentication API security](https://egbert.net/blog/articles/api-security-checklist.html) 
article of mine.
